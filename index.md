# About Me

I'm Dinesh Adhikari, a Web & UI Designer based in New Delhi, India.

I’m currently working as a UI Designer/Developer for [Headerlabs Infotech](http://headerlabs.com/). Previously, I worked as a Web & UI Designer for [Way2online (way2sms)](http://www.way2online.net/).

On this site, you’ll find some designs, some articles I’ve written, and a little about me.
